    This library can be used to copy files to and from a remote machine using Secure Copy (SCP). It uses the
    Paramiko SSH Python library (just like robotframework-sshlibrary) and an SCP wrapper ('scp' by James Bardin).

    The library does not currently support Jython or IronPython at this time.

    - `Connection`
    - `File transfer`

    = Connection =

    Before files can be transferred a connection to remote machine must first be made. A connection can be made with the
    `Open Connection` keyword. Both normal username/password authentication and asymmetric key-pair authentication may
    be used.

    Connections should be closed using the `Close Connection` when they are no longer in use.

    = File transfer =

    Files and directories can be uploaded to the remote machine using the `Put File` or `Put Directory` keywords or
    downloaded to the local machine using the `Get File` keyword.

    A connection must be made using the `Open Connection` keyword before file transfers may be made.
